# WeatherTop
The official GitHub repository of the WeatherTop web application. This aim of this application is to take readings from the WeatherTop 1000, a low-cost, modular device which takes a set of meteorological readings, and display these readings on this companion web app. We are currently on Release 3 of this application, which is very feature-rich including a members dashboard, weather trends, custom Station names and locations & complex calculations such as a "feels like" temperature.

This web app is developed with [Play Framework 1.5.3](https://www.playframework.com) and the front end is built with [Bulma](https://bulma.io). It also includes imagery from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) and icons from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com).

A companion video explaining the code base can be found at [this YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqjRBALSBjQ) by Jordan Harrison, student number 20095397 at Waterford Institute of Technology.

In hindsight, the devlopment of these versions should have been done using a separate development branch, but by the time I realised this I had already completed the first release.

Any questions, get in touch on Slack or email 20095397@mail.wit.ie
